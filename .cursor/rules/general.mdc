Cursor agents should write code in a functional style wherever practical: favoring immutability, pure functions, explicit data flow, and composition over shared state and side effects. Code must be functionally correct, concise, and elegant, expressing intent through strong abstractions, naming, and structure rather than commentary. Comments should be minimal and used only when capturing non-obvious constraints, invariants, or architectural decisions that cannot be inferred from the code itself—never to restate what the code already makes clear. Implementations should be thoughtful and deliberate, avoiding incidental complexity while remaining robust under scale. All code must be dependable and architecturally sound, prioritizing modularity, clear interfaces, testability, and ease of extension. Assume code will be read, reused, and operated at scale: optimize for correctness, composability, and long-term maintainability over cleverness or verbosity.
